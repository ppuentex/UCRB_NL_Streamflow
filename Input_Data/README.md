### This folder contains all the stream flow reconstruction and observations used for nonlinear analysis.

#### Observed Data

The data-processing folder contains the raw observed stream flow data for the Colorado River Basin retrieved from [Bureau of Reclamation](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/NaturalFlow/current.html) along with a Jupyter Notebook that processes this data in order to retrieve only the total annual water year stream flow for the gauges of interest. This workflow created the MultiObserved_data.csv in the Input_Data folder.

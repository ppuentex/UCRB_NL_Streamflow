### This folder contains all the code to perform analysis on streamflow time series and code to create the figures included in this paper.

#### Analysis.R 
This file contains streamflow time series combination of reconstructions and observed. Performance of wavelet transform, finding embedding parameters, calculating average Lyapunov exponents, rolling average/variance, and max/min average LLE values. 
  - This script outputs analysis to the Output_Data folder. 
  
#### Figures.R
